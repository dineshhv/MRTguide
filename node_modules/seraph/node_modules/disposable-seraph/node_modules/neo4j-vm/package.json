  "readme": "# neo4j-vm\n\nis a neo4j version manager for nodejs. it will download and extract whichever\nversion of neo4j you ask for.\n\n## install\n\n```\nnpm install neo4j-vm\n```\n\n## example \n\n```javascript\nvar nvm = require('neo4j-vm');\nnvm('1.9.M01', 'community', function(err, neodir) {\n  //assuming nothing went wrong, neodir is now an absolute path to the neo4j\n  //directory of the version you requested.\n});\n```\n\n## usage\n\n`function neo4jvm(version, edition, noclean, callback)`\n\n* *version* - the version of neo4j - for example '1.9.M01'\n* *edition* - the edition of neo4j - for example 'community'\n* *noclean* (optional, default=true) - in the event that this version has\n  already be downloaded, if this is set to true, callback is immediately called\n  with the path of that install\n* *callback* - function(err, absolutePathToNeo4jInstall)\n\n## note about speed\n\nNeo4j is about 50mb. The first time you download a version, it takes a little\nwhile (dependant on your connection and location, of course).\n\n## note about portability\n\nneo4jvm uses curl and some native binaries like rm to function. Consequently, it\nwill not work on windows.\n",
